. Introduction

'Extract' is a command line tool for extracting SQL and other code
from marked up text files that are able to represent pre-formated text sections.

Currently, two such text formats are explicitly supported - Markdown and MaxText.
MaxText is a plain text markup system that is similar conceptually to Markdown.
